# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to use GitHub Repository, GitHub Desktop Application and GitBash.

**Thoughts:** Končno sem ugotovil kako se dela z GitHubom, kako naj ga uporabljam, kako delati spremembe, izbrisati history in da ga lahko uporabljam na lokalnem računalniku. Super mislim, da napredujem :) Končal Basic CSS course na freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: Dobro napredujem, edino preveč pozno ponoči je že. Lahko da CSS Grid vzame okoli 2-3 dni ampak bo že šlo :) (Ne pozabi na GridGarden igro :P).
