### Day 22: September 9, 2018

### Day 35: November 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm finally back after 2 weeks. I haven't had the strength to deal with learning beacuse I'm buying new apartment and I have to deal with all this stress when buying expensive things. I finished second media querie 768px breakpoint, 2 more to go 😛😎🤭

**Thoughts**: Končno končal ta jebeni huddle landing page, preveč dolgo sem to zlagal pa meril, sedaj moram dobro zastaviti naslednji cilj, ne biti tako pikolovski, naštudirati javascript in delati page-e iz zakupljenega template-ta :D Voila!!!!

### Day 45: June 23, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished reading section Object prototypes from MDN web docs. It's quite easy to understand the concept. I started to continue my freeCodeCamp curriculum on ES6. I finished the day with one exercise from hackerrank and one from CodeWars. 🤓🤓🧐

### Day 46: July 19, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Finally finished ES6 section on freeCodeCamp. I think ES6 has some really powerful features and I really liked them. I need to get up on some serious project quickly :) Next section tomorrow: my favourite one - !)%=!)("$REGEX)(=!("!(#🥳🤞🤪 I can't wait :)

**Thoughts**: ECMAScript 6 je ena izmed najboljših stvari. Komaj čakam, da jih bom lahko uporabljal v kakem projektu. Komaj čakam, da postanem junior developer :) In you face, bad people!

### Day 47: August 31, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I created my plan on courses that I plan to finish and today I started with a nice course from Wes Bos on mastering markdown :) I've restyled my 100days of code repository and added my emoji. Tomorrow I finish it and continue with F-E course from udemy^^ #100DaysOfCode 

**Thoughts**: Končno si pošlihtal zadeve, uredil taske, zdaj pa jih samo izpolnjuj in se usmeri samo nato. Nič ni bolj pomembno kot to, da dokončaš zadeve, ki si si jih zastavil.

### Day 48: September 30, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Wow, back again after 1 month?!? Time flies so fast. Well, just finished Formatting with CSS of Udemy course: Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3.@jonasschmedtman is a great teacher and I definitely need to repeat the basics.🤓🚀🌛 

**Thoughts**: Dejansko si ta mesec sprevidel, da si zmožen delati trdo za uspehe, vse ti uspeva tudi php programiranje, to leto bo še zanimivo^^ :)

### Day 49: November 12, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Back after 1 month and a half. Finished HEADER section for OMNIFood project from Udemy course. Learned how to properly style buttons so they actually look like buttons :) Tomorrow I continue, I promise ;)

**Thoughts**: Evo pa je šel spet 1 mesec in še nekaj dni, boš pa zdaj vsaj v zimskih mesecih delal toliko bolj, da dejansko nekam prideš :) Ni težko, ampak so basic stvari in se najdejo še kakšne stvari, ki jih do zdaj nisi vedel.

### Day 50: November 24, 2019

**Today's Progress**: My first special day :) I took more time to finished *meals, how it works and half of cities* section of OMNIFood project from udemy. Also Udemy stopped working so I had to take a break :) Can't wait to finish my first 100days 😜 Btw, anyone still uses clearfix?🙃

**Thoughts**: Naučil si se kako uporabljati clearfix ko uporabljaš float. Vedno je potrebno narediti clearfix. Obstaja tudi novi property ki to reši display: flow-root. Drugače float je že malo zastarel, lahko kar uporabljaš flexbox. In gremo naprej! 😁

### Day 51: November 26, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished customer testimonials section for Omnifood project. What's left is sign up section, contact form and the footer. Jonas Schmedtmann is a really cool guy 👨‍🏫👌I will finish this course very fast. It's Beginning To Look A Lot Like Coding 👨‍💻🎅🎄

**Thoughts**: Božični čas in seveda bom imel ogromno časa programirati :) Komaj čakam :P

### Day 52: February 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today I finished 8 exercises of Basic Data Structures from Javascript section on freeCodeCamp, I already know this section of javascript so I'm just going fast through it.

**Thoughts**: Božični čas je mimo, pomlad je skoraj tukaj :) To sekcijo lahko dejansko delam vsak dan po 10 vaj 1 uro in končam to do poletja. The game is on.

### Day 53: February 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I managed to finish Basic Data Structures section :) I think it was my fastest section, I'm getting faster with each lesson. And today I'm doing Basic Algorithm Scripting, will tweet again in the evening :)

**Thoughts**: Ta sekcija je bila zabavna, všeč so mi objecti in arrayi, upam, da pridem čim hitreje do API-jev :)

### Day 54: February 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished 13 lessons in Basic Algorithm Scripting over 2 days, 3 more left, must finish it tomorrow. Next section is Object Oriented Programming🚀🤟 I need to speed up p 🤪 I will get back to Drupal for the weekend.  Let's see if I can post here every day🤔

**Thoughts**: Jaz mislim, da mi kar grejo tile algoritmi, definitivno pa bom moral še vaditi na CodeWars, ker je zelo pomembno, da dobiš tempo kot ga imajo drugi.

### Day 55: March 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Last week I did OOP and today I finished with Functional programming section on @freeCodeCamp I'm not that quick as @florinpop1705 but I'm getting faster&smarter every day🤓 One more section before projects.🙌I'll finish this day with a random quote. night🌃#100DaysOfCode

**Thoughts**: Funkcionalno programiranje je bilo kar zanimivo, ampak algoritmi bodo še bolj :D Komaj čakam projekte :)

**Thoughts**: Bilo je težko, ampak do zdaj sem še vedno vse rešil :) Komaj čakam, da končam te projekte, dobim končno nov certifikat in grem nazaj spet na front-end in delat nove spletne strani, kul bo tudi wes boss :)

### Day 57: March 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: #1 of 5 DONE ✅Palindrome Checker First one wasn't hard, I think it took me about 30 min. Today I bought beginnerjavascript.com course from Wes Bos. Can't wait to dig deeper. Plan for tomorrow: #2 mini project, beginnerjavascript and maybe some HTML&CSS.

**Thoughts**: Prvi ni bil tako težki, čakajo me rimske številke, verjetno bo fun :D upam da končam pod 2 uri :)

### Day 58: March 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: #2 of 5 ✅Roman Numeral Converter Second mini project done, 3 more to go before new certificate to put it on my dashboard:DI also finished the contact form section for OmniFood project. Will try probably finish it in one week so I can do next projects.

**Thoughts**: Drugi je bil kar zanimiv, naučil sem se kako lahko razbiješ številke na desetice, stotice in tisočice z simple loopom. Jutri bo še zanimivo, ko bom delal 3-ji mini projekt :)

### Day 59: March 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: #3 of 5 ✅Caesars Cipher done, 2 more to go :) I've also finished part 1 of responsive media queries for Omnifood project. I admit, was a bit lazy today (Counter-Strike), but won't be tomorrow, I promise :D

**Thoughts**: Ok, 3-ji tudi ni bil tako težek, malo bi se lahko lepše potrudil pri kodi ampak je naloga rešena tudi tako. Malo preveč CS-ja sem igral  danes ampak imam zadnji dan dopusta :)

### Day 60: March 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: #4 of 5 ✅ Telephone Number Validator This one was so fun and reminded me about how much I love Regex💌🤟 I've also completed section about media queries & browser optimization for Omnifood. Tomorrow the last project :=) Hope it goes smoothly :)

**Thoughts**: Tale mini projekt je bil kar kul, regex mi kar gre :) Takoj ko dobiš certifikat je prva stvar, da čim hitreje končaš Omnifood, da lahko greš na Wes Bosa :)

### Day 61: March 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Day 61: #5 of 5
✅ Cash Register DONE! :D That one was pretty hard, but I managed to do it, was up till 2 am in the morning and was to tired to tweet but now I'm proudly presenting my 2nd certificate from @freeCodeCamp
🧑🎓 https://freecodecamp.org/certification/janez33/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures

**Thoughts**: To je bila verjetno najtežja naloga do zdaj ampak sem jo rešil čisto brez vsakršne pomoči, mogoče sem malo preveč dolgo reševal in si nisem lepo strukturiral naloge ampak ok imam certifikat :)

### Day 62: April 9, 2020
