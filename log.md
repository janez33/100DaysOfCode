### Day 22: September 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished first section (Introduction) for my Personal Portfolio Webpage on freeCodeCamp. Only 2 sections left: projects and contact section. It should be easy, I think I'm spending too much on a design than actual experience. CSSGrid is almost responsive.😂

### Day 32: November 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed CSS Grid course from Scrimba for better understanding of CSS layout. Started to build landing page for a challenge from https://www.frontendmentor.io/. Feels good, visual studio code is just amazing 😍

### Day 35: November 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I'm finally back after 2 weeks. I haven't had the strength to deal with learning beacuse I'm buying new apartment and I have to deal with all this stress when buying expensive things. I finished second media querie 768px breakpoint, 2 more to go 😛😎🤭

**Thoughts**: Končno kar velik napredek, malo težko bo edino poštudirati kako narediti flex container za footer, da bo credits prišel točno tam kjer mora :)
